# Boing Ball Demo

A toy project to (re)familiarize myself with C and to introduce myself to Raylib.

## The Goal

Recreate the 1984 Amiga Boing Ball demo using C and Raylib.

### Why Raylib? Why not `OpenGL`?

`OpenGL` was my first choice actually, and I ended up putting in two or so weeks of following tutorials and the like, only to realize that at some point towards the end of my attempt that my memory buffer was full and that I had done little more than follow the tutorial. So I put down `OpenGL` and cast my fervent gaze around for something that would let me interact with the deeper concepts of Graphics programming from a more digestable distance, which is when I found Raylib.

Raylib's cheatsheet/learn by doing approach was a good fit, letting me spend more time solving problems myself instead of endlessly googling them.

### Why the boing ball demo?

I lay the blame for this squarely at the foot of Youtuber Ahoy and his `Flatline` documentary covering the Amiga. Its a shallow reason, but it was a fun one nonetheless.

### The Fun and the Learning.

This was a nice, refreshing plunge back into what I consider a 'fun' problem. It was the perfect storm of knowing all the requisite mathematical theory (expect Quaternions, those are a new one) and the programming know-how to work with everything. Its the feeling of sitting down and despite not knowing immediately what needs to be done, you know that you've got everything you need stored in your grey matter.
